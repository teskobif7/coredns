# Middleware


# Documentation

Each middleware should have a README.md explaining what the middleware does and how it is
configured. The file should have the following layout:

* Title: use the middleware's name
* Subsection titled: "Syntax"
* Subsection titled: "Examples"

More sections are of course possible.

## Style

We use the Unix manual page style:

* The name of middleware in the running text should be italic: *middleware*.
* all CAPITAL: user supplied argument, in the running text references this use strong text: `**`:
  **EXAMPLE**.
* Optional text: in block quotes: `[optional]`.
* Use three dots to indicate multiple options are allowed: `arg...`.
* Item used literal: `literal`.
