# CoreDNS

CoreDNS is DNS server that started as a fork of [Caddy](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/). It has the
same model: it chains middleware.

It is in the early stages of development on should be used on production servers. For now most
documentation is in the source and some blog articles can be [found
here](https://miek.nl/tags/coredns/).

<https://caddyserver.com/> is also full of examples on how to structure a Corefile (renamed from
Caddyfile when I forked it).
