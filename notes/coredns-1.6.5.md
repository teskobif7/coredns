The CoreDNS team has released
[CoreDNS-1.6.5](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.6.5).

A fairly small release that polishes various plugins and fixes a bunch of bugs.

# Plugins

* [*forward*](/plugins/forward) don't block on returning sockets; instead timeout and drop the
  socket on the floor, this makes each go-routine guarantee to exit .
* [*kubernetes*](/plugins/kubernetes) adds metrics to measure kubernetes control plane latency, see
  documentation for details.
* [*file*](/plugins/file) fixes a panic when comparing domains names
