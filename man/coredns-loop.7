.SH "NAME"
\fIloop\fR \- detect simple forwarding loops and halt the server\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIloop\fR plugin will send a random query to ourselves and will then keep track of how many times we see it\. If we see it more than twice, we assume CoreDNS is looping and we halt the process\.
.
.P
The plugin will try to send the query for up to 30 seconds\. This is done to give CoreDNS enough time to start up\. Once a query has been successfully sent \fIloop\fR disables itself to prevent a query of death\.
.
.P
The query sent is \fB<random number>\.<random number>\.zone\fR with type set to HINFO\.
.
.SH "SYNTAX"

.nf

loop
.
.fi
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Start a server on the default port and load the \fIloop\fR and \fIforward\fR plugins\. The \fIforward\fR plugin forwards to it self\.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
the loop must be present at start up time\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
the loop must occur for at least the \fBHINFO\fR query type\.
